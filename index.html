      <p>I’m a Belgian-Eritrean independent investigative journalist based in Rome.</p>
      <p>My reporting focuses on science, health, technology, and the environment, with work published in <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>National Geographic</em>, <em>Bellingcat</em>, <em>Science</em>, and more. 
      <p>I combine open-source research methods—FOI requests, satellite imagery, court documents, trade data, social media, and data analysis—with traditional reporting to tell deeply researched, compelling stories.</p>
      <p>Previously, I was an investigative reporting fellow with Lighthouse Reports, where I focused on food systems and surveillance. In 2022, my work won the American Society of Journalists and Authors Award for science reporting. In 2023, I contributed to a series that received the National Association of Black Journalists award.</p>
      <p>Before journalism, I studied neuroscience and philosophy at University College London, followed by an MSc in cognitive neuroscience. I also hold an MA in science, health, and environmental journalism from NYU.</p>
      <p>I’m an avid cyclist, a budding gardener, and I report in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese.</p>
